                            <div> Let's get to know me a little more better, Albeit hopefully better than a Zoom meeting with a spotty webcam. </div>
                            <div> I came upon Dungeons and Dragons Back in March of 2022 looking for a new hobby to try out. </div>
                            <div> So I got the Essentials Kit and went off to start a D&D Club back in Middle School </div>
                            <div> Over time I try to perfect the feelings and emotions that players can get when playing in character </div>
                            <div> Hence is what I love most about D&D! </div>
                            <div> Currently I'm experiencing what it's like to be in High School, with the many choices I have </div>
                            <div> I decided upon taking a course I've been waiting a while to try: Computer Science! </div>
                            <div> (Probably why you see me here!) </div>
                            <div> I'm still learning so I may stop by to give you an update but time will tell. </div>
                            <div> Now sadly I got to split, some more coding awaits but it's still a joy to meet you and I hope we will meet again in the future! </div>                                <div> Ciao! </div>
